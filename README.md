# ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES

Our application, Saverapp, is an application intended for young students who have trouble saving and managing their money.

When the user enters the App, he would have to register/login, depending if it is his first time using our App.

Once the user is in his account, the user will be asked for his monthly budget and the percentage of money they would like to save at the end of each month from their budget. 
Later, they will also need to add their interest areas in which they typically spend their money, and the percentage of their money they would like to spend in each area. For example: {cothes:30% , food: 30% , clubs: 40%}. The program sets a limit figure for spending in each area. 

The user can check the areas and the amount he set in each of them.

Then the App has an expense tracker. In this section, the user is able to track all his monthly expenses, in order to be as organized as possible and reach his objectives. In every moment, the user can see a table with the expenses, the category they belong to and the date.

Finally, in order to check how much more money he can spend on each category, a table is displayed with the total amount spent on each category, it he has more money left or not, and hw much money he has left. In the case of the user spending more money than he could on one of the categories, the user will notice by looking at this table.

This project is very useful for students who live abroad or even at home to better manage their money, be aware of their expenses and help them save money.
